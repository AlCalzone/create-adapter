# Fix CSS React UI height in Firefox

This migration is **only relevant** if you're using a **React UI** for Admin.

To update, change `admin/style.css` as follows:

```diff
        /* Don't cut off dropdowns! */
        overflow: initial;
 }
-.m.adapter-container {
+.m.adapter-container,
+.m.adapter-container > div.App {
        /* Fix layout/scrolling issues with tabs */
        height: 100%;
        width: 100%;
```
