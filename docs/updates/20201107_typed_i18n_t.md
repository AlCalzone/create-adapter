# Add better types for the `I18n.t` function based on words in `i18n/en.json` for React UI

This migration is **only relevant** if you're using **React** for the Admin UI.

It will add better types for the translate function `I18n.t` so that TypeScript will only accept words defined in the
English translation file.
Doing so you can't forget to add new translations to at least the English translation file.

## Migration

Add the file `admin/src/i18n/i18n.d.ts` whith the contents from [here](../../test/baselines/adapter_TS_React/admin/i18n/i18n.d.ts).
