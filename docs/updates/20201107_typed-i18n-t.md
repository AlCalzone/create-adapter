# Add better types for the `I18n.t` function based on words in `i18n/en.json` for TypeScript React UI

This migration is **only relevant** if you're using TypeScript and a **React UI** for Admin.

It will add better types for the translate function `I18n.t` so that TypeScript will only accept words defined in the
English translation file.
Doing so you can't forget to add new translations to at least the English translation file.

## Migration

Add the file `admin/src/i18n.ts` whith the contents from [this](../../test/baselines/adapter_TS_React/admin/src/i18n.ts).

Change all imports of `I18n` in your react components from

```ts
import I18n from "@iobroker/adapter-react/i18n";
```

to

```ts
import I18n from "../i18n";
```

using the correct relative path to the new `i18n.ts` file.
